            Riverside Recovery is Recovery Residence designed specifically for young men ages 18-28 that have
            struggled with substance abuse and addiction. Situated on private riverfront property in North Palm 
            Beach, FL.

            We take a common sense approach to rehabilitation. Rather than being institutional, we implement a 
            highly structured program in a casual living environment with onsite staff 24 hours a day. All of our 
            residents have individualized and structured recovery plans in place designed specifically for them by our 
            staff. Our clients participate in daily group activities, recreation therapy, community outings, and 12-step 
            applications in a supportive, brotherhood-focused community. Although Riverside Recovery is a recovery 
            residence provider, our individualized and hands-on approach to the services we offer for young men 
            stand out from those of standard recovery residence programs across the area.

            What makes us really unique, however, is our belief in teaching young men to live life on lifeâ€™s terms. 
            Our goal is to instill a love for the life that they have been graciously given. Fun, love, and helping others 
            are the answers to a successful rehabilitation at Riverside Recovery.
