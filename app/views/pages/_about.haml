          %p A structured living environment is an essential part of recovery. It sets a person up to maintain long term sobriety. At Riverside Recovery, we believe in fostering a healthy 12- step recovery program while instilling work ethic, self- sufficiency, personal responsibility and accountability. The structure of our recovery residence promotes the growth of healthy habits and offers the serenity for our residents to appreciate the blessings of sobriety. Our clients will feel greater distance from the monotony of active addiction.
